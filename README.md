``` 
- `cd emberjs-times-tools`

- set the `GOODBITS_USER_EMAIL` and `GOODBITS_USER_PASSWORD` env variables in e.g. your `~/.bashrc` (ping @jessica on [the Ember Community Slack](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS) for the credentials):
```

export GOODBITS_USER_PASSWORD="goodbits-bot-password"
```
- reload the settings in your current terminal tab
```
source ~/.bashrc

- finally run the script and pass in the url pointing to the latest blog post:
```
node create-goodbits-template.js --botemail="$GOODBITS_USER_EMAIL" --botpassword="$GOODBITS_USER_PASSWORD" --botblogurl="https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/11/16/the-ember-times-issue-73.html"
```
- use the `--debug=true` for development and debugging üíõ
- review üëÄ and feel free to improve the template at [Goodbits](https://goodbits.io/c/7430/emails) - this tool isn't perfect, but tries its best to help with the mundane copy-pasta work ‚úçÔ∏è
